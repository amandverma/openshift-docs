= Automating the integration process with systemd for bootc systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must include the entire `auto-recovery` process for bootc systems that use `systemd` in the container file.
====

As a use case, consider the following example situation in which you want to automate the `auto-recovery` process for bootc systems that use systemd.

.Prerequisites

* You have created the `10-auto-recovery.conf` and `microshift-auto-recovery.service` files as explained in the the "Automating the integration process with systemd for RPM systems" section.
* You have created the `microshift-auto-recovery` script as explained in the the "Automating the integration process with systemd for RPM systems" section.

.Procedure

* Use the following example to update your Containerfile that you use to prepare the bootc image.
