// Should sentence below say "to which a digest or tag refers"?

With oc-mirror plugin v2, `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS) resources are generated by default if at least one image of the image set is mirrored by digest.
`ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS) resources are generated if at least one image from the image set is mirrored by tag.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) uses the `CatalogSource` resource to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry.

The OpenShift Update Service uses the `UpdateService` resource to provide update graph data to the disconnected environment.
